# knights

This is an ongoing personal project built with Flutter.
It features a simple game called "Knights" where a player must
traverse an 8x8 board as a Knight moves in Chess to cover every spot on the board.
Currently the game logic is functional. The app can time, pause, and resume games.

I am in the process of incorporating Google Firebase so users can create accounts that
track their top scores. The app will also feature a live list of the top 10 scores of all registered users.
